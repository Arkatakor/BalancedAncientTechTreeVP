The former is used when working with crystalline materials such as flint, chert and obsidian. The worker taps the stone with a harder stone, carefully chipping off stone flakes until the stone has been properly shaped. Mesoamerican tribes used this method to make their sharp and deadly obsidian swords. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The grinding method is used when working with harder and coarser materials such as basalt and granite. This is a long and tedious process in which the toolmaker repeatedly grinds away the stone with a harder material or with sand, sometimes using water as a lubricant. Many of the earliest European stone axes were made using this process.');

The spears from Schöningen (Germany) provide some of the first examples of wooden hunting gear. Flint tools were used for carving. Since Neolithic times, carved wooden vessels are known, for example, from the Linear Pottery culture wells at Kückhofen and Eythra.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Examples of Bronze Age wood-carving include tree trunks worked into coffins from northern Germany and Denmark and wooden folding-chairs. The site of Fellbach-Schmieden in Germany has provided fine examples of wooden animal statues from the Iron Age Wooden idols from the La Tène period are known from a sanctuary at the source of the Seine in France.');
